======================================================

This example demonstrates the usage of the filters in my [Wordpress Before After Image plugin](http://blog.scrobble.me/wordpress-jquery-before-after-image-slider/) (introduced in version 1.6).

Tip: This is also a nice way to change the images with any html content.
